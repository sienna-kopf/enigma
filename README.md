# Enigma

Solo-project!!!

Overall, I am very happy with my performance on this project. I managed to reach my goal of completing all the iteration 3 functionality and believe that I went above and beyond in multiple other areas. I am most proud of the way in which I went about completing this project. I stand by the way in which I organized my project as I think it makes it very clean and dry! I practiced really good TDD, writing robust tests and only enough code to make them pass. I also managed to use a very helpful module which was cool, and learned alot about command line arguments.

LATE:

Based on the rubric:
3 in functionality
4 in OOP
3(+) in Conventions and Mechanics
4 in TDD
4 in Version Control

= 3.6 average score!
